# Outlast - ReadMe

This game, **Outlast**, was tested using its Humble Bundle version using downloaded file named `Outlast-DRMFree-Patch2.zip` from Humble Bundle Library.

Game runs at around 30 fps on low/medium details on RP5, might get better inside I just played the intro and moved around outside a bit.

Sometimes hangs on black screen on Exit Game, Start + Select to kill the process.
