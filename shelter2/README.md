# Shelter 2 - ReadMe

This game, **Shelter 2**, was tested using its Humble Bundle version using downloaded file named `PC_Shelter2_Build20150708.zip` from Humble Bundle Library.

Game runs at stable 60 fps on RP5 on default settings at 1920*1080

Keybindings can be changed in `shelter2.gptk` defaults below - I've not put much thought into it, just made them comfortable enough to run around the start area:

back = esc
start = \"

up = up
down = down
left = left
right = right

left_analog_up = w
left_analog_down = s
left_analog_left = a
left_analog_right = d

right_analog_up = mouse_movement_up
right_analog_down = mouse_movement_down
right_analog_left = mouse_movement_left
right_analog_right = mouse_movement_right

deadzone_mode = scaled_radial
deadzone = 2000
deadzone_scale = 8
deadzone_delay = 16

a = mouse_left
b = space
x = mouse_right
y = m

l1 = \"
l2 = leftshift

r1 = c
r2 = \"
