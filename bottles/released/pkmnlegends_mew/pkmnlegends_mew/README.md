## Installation
Download the Windows version of the game from https://ragdim.itch.io/legends-mew and unzip the contents of the `PML` folder to the `pkmnlegends_mew/data` folder.

## Control Alignment
If the ui does not align with your physical buttons, try toggling different controller modes in the options menu.
