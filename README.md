# Jeod's Wine Bottles

This repository hosts wine bottles compatible with [Pharos](https://github.com/JeodC/Pharos), so they can be downloaded directly to your aarch64 environment assuming you have a `roms/windows` emulationstation folder.

## Missing X

This repository does not host wine bottles for any games requiring DRM bypass such as select Steam titles. If any bottles have multiple platform releases and one or more have DRM, a README will instruct which is preferred to use.

Pull requests to add DRM-bypassed bottles will be denied. Pull requests adding DRM-free wine bottles are welcome.
